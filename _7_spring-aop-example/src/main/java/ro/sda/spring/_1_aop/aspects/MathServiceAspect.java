/*

-> Aspect:
 An aspect is a class that implements enterprise application concerns that cut across multiple classes, such as transaction management.

-> Join point:
 A join-point is a candidate point in the Program Execution of the application where an aspect can be plugged in.
 This point could be a method being called, an exception being thrown, or even a field being modified.
 These are the points where your aspect’s code can be inserted into the normal flow of your application to add new behavior.
 In Spring AOP a join point is always the execution of a method.

-> Advice:
 Advices are actions taken for a particular join point.

-> Pointcut:
 A pointcut defines at what join-points, the associated Advice should be applied.
 Advice can be applied at any join-point supported by the AOP framework.
 Of course, you don’t want to apply all of your aspects at all the possible join-points.
 Pointcuts allow you to specify where you want your advice to be applied.


 Explanation using Restaurant Analogy: Source by https://coderanch.com/t/485525/frameworks/Difference-Joint-Point-Point-Cut

 When you go out to a restaurant, you look at a menu and see several options to choose from. You can order one or more of the items on the menu.
 But until you actually order them, they are just "opportunities to dine". Once you place the order and the waiter brings it to your table, it's a meal.

 Join-points are options on the menu and Pointcuts are items you select.

 A Join-point is an opportunity within code for you to apply an aspect...just an opportunity.
 Once you take that opportunity and select one or more join-points and apply an aspect to them, you've got a pointcut.
